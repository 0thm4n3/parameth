# parameth
This tool can be used to brute discover GET and POST parameters

Often when you are directory busting a directory for common files, 
you can identify scripts (for example test.php) that look like they need
to be passed a then unknown parameter. This hopefully can help find them.

***NOTE:***
I will develop this further to account for dynamic pages etc., 
but at least it's a start
